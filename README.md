# pakman

An automatically generated collection of paks for your MinUI installation

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> MinUI must have already been installed and booted at least once on your device. Please follow these steps after installing MinUI.

1. Mount your MinUI SD card.
2. Download the latest release from Github. It will be named `Pakman.zip`.
3. Unzip the `Pakman.zip` file and browse to the new `Pakman` folder.
4. From within the `Pakman` folder, copy the `Emus`, `Roms`, and `Tools` directories onto your SD Card. When prompted, _merge_ the files into place.
5. Confirm that your SD Card now has an `Emus/tg5040/N64.pak/launch.sh` file and a `Tools/tg5040/Developer.pak/launch.sh` file. If these do not exist, the paks were not installed properly. Please file an issue if so.
6. Delete the `Pakman` folder and `Pakman.zip` file
7. Unmount your SD Card and insert it into your MinUI device.

## Usage

See the readme for each pak. Note that certain paks _may_ not be supported on specific platforms; Emu paks are generally platform specific.
